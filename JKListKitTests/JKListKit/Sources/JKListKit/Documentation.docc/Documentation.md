## Main Features

|         | Main Features  |
----------|-----------------
&#128581; | Create vertical list layouts in a simple way. Focus on building sections and then render them in the order you want, in a safe and decoupled way.
&#127968; | Better architecture with reusable views and sections
&#128038; | Data driven UI. The model decides which section will be rendered as well as the order of the sections. Do you want to try applying Server Driven UI ? then go ahead !!
&#128288; | Create layout with multiple data types
&#128273; | Set the side margins and the spacing between sections in a centralized way. 100% customizable for each section if necessary.
&#128269; | Add new sections with no means for something to break. Adding a new section is 100% safe for your current layout.
&#128241; | Simply `UIScrollView + UIStackView` at its core
ùåó | Lazy Loading
&#128640; | Extendable API
üî®   | Fully unit tested [WIP]
üî®   | DI strategy for SectionController [WIP]
